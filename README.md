# Grids
This is a growing collection of retro gaming assets known as grids, usually used to represent a game in a grid or a thumbnail view inside library management software. All grids are 600x900 pixels (2:3) and are as such supported by Steam, Playnite, and other managers. They can naturally be used for any other purpose.

# Methodology
There are a couple things worth noting about this collection. First, understand that not all box arts are naturally in a 2:3 format, so it's often necessary to make adjustements. The grids are not faithful recreation of the box arts. However, I try to use as much of the source material as possible.

Some games will be missing from the collection, I concentrate my efforts on grids that are not available elsewhere. If a grid is not in my collection, it's either because I have not yet worked on it, or because a good grid can already be found elsewhere (for example, on SteamGridDB). Contributions however are welcomed.

For the moment I'm working on providing a grid for every retro game, but not every release of the game. As such, there may be a grid for *Atheltic World (US)* but none for *Family Trainer 1: Athletic World (Japan)*, because they are essentially the same game. My rule is to make a grid for the US release first if there is one, then the European release failing that, and finally the Japanese release as last resort. Please note that the grids are named according to this rule, using the names provided by [no-intro](https://no-intro.org) and [redump](https://redump.org).

# Licensing
The grids are all provided under the creative commons public domain license, meaning they can be reused freely. However, because they were made using original game assets, the grids and the material they represent remain the property of their rightful owner. For all copyright concerns, please reach out to <grids@jenmaarai.org> but please, keep in mind that they are only shared in an effort to preserve gaming history.

# Other Services
You might be wondering why I am not sharing the grids through services like SteamGridDB. As a matter of fact I am unaware of any other alternatives at the moment. SGDB is a good source that nicely complements my work (or the other way around) and I myself shared some of my grids there. However they mostly focus on official Steam releases and modern games, and adding retro games is a painful, manual process. Please reach out to me if an alternative ever arises.
